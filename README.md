## Project Background & SYstem Overview

The COSMIC PPE snorkel mask is designed to function as a reusable combination of a N95 respirator and face shield. Our team has modified a DasMeer full face snorkel mask by adding a 3D printed, custom fit adapter to the top outlet that will allow the mask to be connected to a hospital-grade, high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter with 99.99% bacterial and viral filtration efficiency. The purpose of the mask is to provide protection against airborne and droplet particles.

Unfiltered air is drawn through a hospital grade HEPA filter at the top of the mask then respired air is expelled out through a check valve on the lower front of the mask. The intended user populations include health care providers, including, but not limited to, doctors, nurses, first responders, and respiratory therapists, who are in close contact with patients who may be carriers of the COVID-19 virus. The device is intended to be used in hospitals or in the field of work, as is the case for first responders.

These retrofitted respirators have NOT received regulatory approval. Appropriate use, decontamination, and regulatory approval of the design should be directed through your local health authority.
